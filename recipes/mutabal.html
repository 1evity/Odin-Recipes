    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Mutabal recipe which is also known as baba ghanoush, is a Palestinian eggplant dip made with a delicious smoky flavor of roasted eggplant, mixed with tahini paste, garlic, fresh lemon juice, and salt.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Eggplants (Medium-Large size)</li>
        <li>2 Garlic cloves</li>
        <li>⅓ cup Tahini (Sesame paste)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Lemon Juice</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to taste (I used 1 teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper)</li>
        <li>Optional: Olive oil, cumin, paprika, chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your fire, broiler, or grill to the highest heat. Once preheated, pierce your eggplants 5 or 6 times each and place whole eggplants on or under the heat source. Turn every 5 minutes or so until the whole outside is charred and the eggplants are soft inside. This will take approximately 20 minutes. Remove and let cool until you can handle it.</li>
        <li>Puree your garlic with the salt using a mortar and pestle, in a bowl with a fork, or in your food processor. (Add ¼ teaspoon cumin at this point if you are using it.) Then add tahini and mix well.</li>
        <li>Remove eggplant pulp from its skin and add to your tahini mixture. Add lemon juice and start mashing or mixing until you reach the texture you like. This can be chunky and rustic, smooth and silky, or anywhere in between. Season with salt (½-1 tsp) and pepper to taste, and serve with pita bread or other foods to dip in it.</li>
        <li>Optional garnishes: Drizzle with olive oil or sprinkle with paprika or parsley.</li>
    </ol>

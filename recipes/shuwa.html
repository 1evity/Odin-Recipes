    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Omani Shuwa is a flavorful marinated lamb cooked in a special oven, a pit underground. Slow cooked for hours until juicy and tender. It is a delicacy prepared for special occasions.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Lamb Shanks</li>
        <li>2 tsp Garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 tsp Ginger Garlic Paste</li>
        <li>¾ tsp Black Pepper Powder</li>
        <li>¾ tsp Cumin Powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp Coriander Powder</li>
        <li>10 Cloves or ¼ tsp Cloves Powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp Chili Powder</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Vinegar</li>
        <li>1 Lime, juiced</li>
        <li>2 – 2 ½ tsp Salt (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>2 ½ – 3 tbsp Oil</li>
        <li>Banana tree leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash lamb shanks and make big and deep gashes. This is very important if you want a flavorful spicy meat.</li>
        <li>Mix all the ingredients except lamb to a paste.</li>
        <li>Rub this spice paste onto the lamb and into the gashes. Use your fingers to rub the meat as deep as you can.</li>
        <li>Take a baking dish and place a banana leaf in it. Place the lamb on the leaf and pour any remaining spice mixture over it.</li>
        <li>Fold the banana leaf over the lamb to cover the lamb, and it should look like a packet. Cover the baking dish and marinate in the refrigerator overnight or for 24–48 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove marinated lamb from the fridge and leave it on the countertop for 30–60 minutes before cooking to bring it to room temperature (this step is optional).</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 250°F and place the baking dish in the oven. Do not forget to remove the cover/lid of the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake lamb wrapped in banana leaf for 3 hours or until the meat is tender. Turn the meat around every 1–1½ hours.</li>
        <li>It took 3 hours in my oven, and the meat was tender. Depending on the size and thickness of the meat, you may have to cook it longer.</li>
        <li>Change the oven temperature to 350°F, open the banana wrap, and cook for another 20 minutes until the meat is dark brown.</li>
        <li>After cooking for 3 hours, the banana wrap will dry up and begin to fall apart. I left the leaf in the dish itself and opened/removed the leaf on the top before roasting it at 350°F.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and let the meat rest for at least 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>I served it with flavored rice.</li>
    </ol>

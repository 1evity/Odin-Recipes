    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Nabeez, also known as Nabidh and Nabeedh was one of the favourite drinks of the Prophet Muhammad (SAWS) and hence considered a Sunnah. Itâ€™s traditionally made with either dates or raisins but never mixed.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ajwa or whichever date is available (3-4 Dates)</li>
        <li>Water (1 Glass)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak dates overnight in a packed container. You can also use raisins if not dates.</li>
        <li>The next morning after Fajr, you can drink the water and eat the soaked dates or raisins like the Prophet (SAWS) used to do.</li>
        <li>The drink should be consumed the next morning or within 12 hours of making it. Any longer and it will start to ferment and produce alcohol.</li>
    </ol>

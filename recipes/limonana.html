    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Limonana is a Levantine/Middle Eastern refreshing mint lemonade. It’s easy to make, and the perfect drink for a warm summer’s day. Lemons are high in vitamin C and said to help digestion, amongst other things.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups water divided</li>
        <li>1 cup lemon juice freshly squeezed from 4-5 large lemons</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mint leaves relatively well packed, around 60 leaves</li>
        <li>2 cups ice cubes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the sugar and 1/2 cup water in a small pan and warm over gentle heat until the sugar dissolves. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Put the sugar syrup, lemon juice, remaining water, mint leaves, and ice cubes in a blender and blend until the mint leaves are well chopped up and everything is well combined. It will be slightly frothy.</li>
        <li>Pour into glasses and serve.</li>
    </ol>

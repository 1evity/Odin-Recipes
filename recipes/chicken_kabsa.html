    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Kabsa is widely recognized as the national dish of Saudi Arabia, but is eaten across the Middle East. Other than a few differences the characteristics of the dish remain the same in most countries. 
        Kabsa literally translated from the Arabic means pressed which is derived from the way it is cooked. The ingredients are piled one on top of the other and cooked in one pot rice dish.

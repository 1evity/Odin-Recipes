    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A close relative to Greek gyros and Turkish d√∂ner kebab, shawarma is the ultimate Middle-Eastern version of street food popular both across Lebanon, as well as in other Arabic countries and across the world. Although it may seem simple at first glance, it actually takes up to 2 days to prepare the original Lebanese shawarma.</p>
